In Python, we can write functions that return a result by using the `return` keyword followed by the result we wish to return. A Python function can return only one value.

Note that for the `hello3()` function, the returned tuple will have a string for the first two elements and an integer for the third element.\n",

    "A standard practice is to employ a *docstring*, or documentation string, comment immediately after the function definition line to provide documentation for the function. Python docstrings help programmers using your function (or class or module) to understand what it does without having to read the detail of the implementation. You can also generate online (HTML) documentation directly from docstrings using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). A docstring comment is enclosed in triple-quotes, as shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers, such as variables, functions, and classes, defined outside of any function or class have **global scope**. **Global variables** are variables with global scope; they can be used in an interactive session (or Jupyter notebook file or .py file) anywhere after they are defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Local variables have **local scope**. This concept is best illustrated by variables defined inside a function. The variable is \"in scope\" only from its definition to the end of the function's block. The variable goes \"out of scope\" when the function returns to its caller. The local variable can only be used inside the function that defines it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another way to think of local scope. When a function is called, Python creates a new environment for that function. The new environment inherits everything from its calling environment. Any arguments passed to the function are created as variables in the function's environment. Those variables, and the function's environment, are deleted once the function returns a value or finishes execution. Functions may reference variables in their calling environment, i.e., the ones with global scope. However, if a function attempts to alter a variable in its calling environment, Python will create a new local variable with the same name. Any changes made to the local variable do not affect the calling environment. This subtlety is illustrated with the examples below."

    "## `lambda` Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions are similar to user-defined functions but are anonymous and more restrictive in their functionality. They are sometimes referred to as \"anonymous functions\". The terms lambda expression, lambda function, or simply lambda are often used interchangeably. Lambda functions are written as a single line of execution and can only contain expressions (instead of including statements in its body). For this reason, they are often used inline and embedded within other code statements. Lambda functions are efficient when you want to create a function that will only contain a simple expression, and they are useful when you are only going to use them once.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a lambda function the syntax is:\n",
