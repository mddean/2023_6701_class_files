    "\n",
    "One of the most useful built-in data types in Python is the dictionary or the `dict` type. A dictionary is a collection that is *mutable*. The elements of the collection are **key-value** pairs. Instead of being indexed by a range of numbers (like a `list` or `tuple`), a dictionary is indexed by *keys* which can be any immutable type. For example, strings and numbers can always be keys. You **cannot** use `list`s as keys since they can be modified in place. The values in the dictionary can be any valid data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to think of dictionaries as *key:value* pairs with the requirement that keys are unique. To create a dictionary, you place comma-separated key:value pairs inside of curly braces, `{}`. You will use the **key** to look up or find the **value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning in Python version 3.7, dictionaries are guaranteed to be **ordered** by insertion order. Older versions of Python do not guarantee insertion order. What this means is that if you print out a dictionary in older Python versions, the results may not be in the order you added data to the dictionary. This change also actually saves memory when creating and using dictionaries.\n",

You can find the *intersection* of sets using the `intersection` method or the shortcut operator `&`. You can also find the *difference* and *symmetric difference* of sets using the `difference` and `symmetric_difference` methods. There are also methods that let you determine if a set is a *subset* or a *superset*. We will not cover these topics here, but I encourage you to explore the ancillary information below for details."
