    "Up until this point, we have dealt only with data that we created \"on the fly\" within our Python programs. We now turn to the all-important concept of ingesting data into a Python program from persistent sources, manipulating it, and then creating output. We will primarily be using \"flat files\" such as `.txt` and `.csv` files to begin our exploration of the built-in I/O capabilities of Python. Then we introduce one of the most-used Python packages for data analysis: `pandas`. The `pandas` package provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures that make working with tabular data easy and intuitive.\n",
